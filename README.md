# Basic-Password-Generator

Hello my name is Brandon, and this is my project about making a basic password generator. I mainly wrote this to help myself improve at coding specically with this I used javascript. I used what I learned from class and really put it to action for this website.

# How I made The Password Generator

I had some starter code to give me a foundation on the basics I needed.I had html and css done that showcase a box and a button. On the javascript side I had a button that was already appropriatly selected, an empty function to where I could write how to generate the password, a function that when all was said and done it would write the password in the box. Since the more popular way of doing things now requires more work on the html and css side creating labels to check whether I wanted uppercase or lowercase and a slider to easily add a number amount to how much characters I wanted. I decided that it ultimately wouldn't help me actually learn javascript that much and decided to stick with writing out prompts and confirms. I used a prompt to signify how much characters someone wanted, I started with a limit of 8 and max of 128. I also set in place if someone wrote anything that wasn't a number or if ther number was longer than 128 it would stop the series of pop up windows and alerted the user why. I chose to stick with confirms to ask for uppercase, etc becuase it already has a built in true or false if you decide to hit ok or cancel. If you hit ok I made sure to include arrays of the needed vaules and if you hit cancel it simply would just not confirm those options and skip past them. I had a lot of issues with trying to define my prompt's value but I later found out it was a simply assignment error. It just goes to show that if even one thing is wrong the whole logic might not work.

# Comments On My Js File

I made sure to add a lot of detailed comments to how for loop worked along with generally what everything was doing not only to help me but to help anyone else looking at what I wrote. Like I said I tried to be as detailed as possible that way I am as transperant as I could be. Except for the for loop most of my comments are breif and to the point giving enough detail and context that was need for myself or others to understand that will hopefully not be overbaring for someone else. I find comments to be very useful as I go on becuase it gives me a good idea and baseline of what to expect when viewing the code at face value.

# What I learned

Like I said earilier I mainly learned that even if everything else is writen comepletley right, if there is just one error the whole logic might not even work. It also helped me once I found out to not stress over what I am doing wrong but what I achieved and done right. That personally gives me the right mindset to keep trying and persisting until I find the solution because when I do I know in the end it is all worth the hassle. I also learned a lot more about javascript than I did without writing this project in the end I am more in tune with how to properly write functions, I learned how to and what properly assigning variables does within code and lastly leanred how to actually write a password generator that works. In the future if I want to make a more robust website to generate random passwords I now have a good baseline to start with.
